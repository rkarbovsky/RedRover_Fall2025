//Create a public class called Cube without a constructor which gets one single private integer variable Side, a getter GetSide() and a setter SetSide(int num) method for this property. Actually, getter and setter methods are not the common way to write this code in C#. In the next kata of this series, we gonna refactor the code and make it a bit more professional...
//
//Notes:
//
//There's no need to check for negative values!
//initialise the side to 0.
